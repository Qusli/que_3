        <p>OUR MISSION</p>
        <h1>We exist to help creators<br>own their audience.</h1>
        <p>We believe that social platforms are taking advantage of creators.<br>We want to change that and help creators fight back. </p>

                    <p>Building a career on social platforms is like building a home on someone else's<br>
            land. While social platforms are great for discovering and reaching your audience,<br>
            your goal as a creator should be to convert your followers into email or text<br>
            message subscribers. Why? Look no further than TikTok. Almost overnight,<br>
            millions of creative people almost lost their careers. </p>
                    <p>If a platform removes your account, or their algorithm for distribution no longer<br>
            favours you, are you prepared? </p>
                    <p>If you want to build a career as a creator, your focus should be on building durable<br>
            distribution channels. Without distribution, you have no business. So how can you<br>
            build an audience that you actually own? With emails and phone numbers. These<br>
            distribution channels are direct. Instead of going through some algorithm, when<br>
            you share over email and text message, you know that your audience will see your<br>
            content. Even better is the fact that you own these lists. Instagram removes your<br>
            acount, you're ok. YouTube changes their algorithm, you're ok. You own your<br>
            audience. </p>
                    <p>We built Marico to make this process easy, fast, and effective. The traditional<br>
            solution to this problem involves spending days building a website or hiring<br>
            someone expensive to do it for you. But those days are gone. With Marico, you<br>
            get a portfolio that is always up-to-date and converts visitors into email or text<br>
            message subscribers. The best thing? It takes under 5 minutes to setup, and it<br>
            automatically updates whenever you post new content anywhere online. We<br>
            believe the best tools are the ones you don't even notice. Marico helps you build<br>
            your own audience, without any hassle or time commitment. All you have to do is<br>
            share your portfolio link with your audience, and we'll handle the rest. </p>
                    <p>You can also create posts from within Marico and share them in just a few clicks<br>
            to your portfolio, and to your email and text message subscribers. Since all of your<br>
            content is already in Marico, creating content takes minutes, not hours. </p>
                    <p>For too long, social platforms have taken advantage of creators. Fight back and<br>
            build an audience that you own. </p>
